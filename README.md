# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that uses a 3X3 board layout. The players choose between two symols - either the X or the O. The end-goal of the game is to ensure that one's sybmols are arranged in a straight line - whether that's horizontally, diaognally or vertically.

This is an excellent challenge for web developers looking to hone their skills.

## Prerequisites

In order to create this game, the prerequisites are a good understanding of:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

### Continued development

I want to continue working on this project to allow for the following in the updates:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- Bonus 1: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- Bonus 2: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

I read about the MinMax algorithm and I look forward to uilding on that too once the basic version of this game is done.

I am keen to repeat this project using ReactJS.
